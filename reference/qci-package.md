# qci: Quality of Care Index from Global Burden of Disease Data

Calculates the Quality of Care Index (QCI) from Global Burden of Disease
(GBD) study data. QCI is a composite metric derived via Principal
Component Analysis from four epidemiological ratios:
Mortality-to-Incidence (MIR), YLL-to-YLD, DALY-to-Prevalence, and
Prevalence-to-Incidence. Provides a complete pipeline from raw GBD CSV
exports to normalized country-level scores, gender disparity analysis,
and publication-ready visualizations including choropleth maps.
