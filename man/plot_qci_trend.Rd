\title{Plot QCI trends over time}
\usage{
plot_qci_trend(
  data,
  locations = NULL,
  sex = c("Male", "Female", "Both"),
  age = "Age-standardized",
  colors = c(Male = "skyblue4", Female = "firebrick", Both = "grey30"),
  facet_by = NULL,
  free_y = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame with columns: \code{year}, \code{qci_score}, \code{sex_name},
\code{location_name}, \code{age_name}.}

\item{locations}{Character vector of location names. Default \code{NULL} (all).}

\item{sex}{Character vector of sex categories to include.
Default \code{c("Male", "Female", "Both")}.}

\item{age}{Character. Default \code{"Age-standardized"}.}

\item{colors}{Named character vector.
Default \code{c(Male = "skyblue4", Female = "firebrick", Both = "grey30")}.}

\item{facet_by}{Character. Column to facet by. When \code{NULL} (default),
auto-facets by \code{location_name} if more than one location is present.
Set to \code{FALSE} to disable auto-faceting.}

\item{free_y}{Logical. Free y-axis scales in facets. Default \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object.
}
\description{
Creates line plots of QCI over years, stratified by sex. When multiple
locations are present, automatically facets by location for readability.

\examples{
data(sample_gbd)
result <- qci_pipeline(sample_gbd)
